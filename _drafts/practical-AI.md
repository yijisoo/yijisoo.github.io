title: Practical AI
---

It is well known that artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten through multiple tides and ?? through its history. People's assumption about how quickly implement human level intelligence has been strikingly wrong (including Alan Turing's prediction of the necessary memory to replicate human intelligence in 1950). In spite of the recent successful demonstration of AlphaGo and various deep learning techniques, the progress toward human-level intelligence seems to be slower compared to all the hypes around artificial intelligence.

At this current stage, I believe that we have to focus on is practical artificial intelligence. 

One of the definitions of intelligence, I think that the following one from ??, "". I believe that the definition includes the pragmatism. In order to achieve the pragmatism, I believe that the following hurdles should be overcome.

1. Lower the cost of learning

Yet, building the 

Facebook M's attempt has been interesting because it has attempted to collect detailed data from 

2. Still understanding natural languages

I partly agree with ??'s blog post regarding deep neural network is not perfectly aligned approach to learn human language. 

3. What's the most cognitive difficulties that human being have.

There are some tasks that human agents have more difficulties than others.

Open Q&A. 
Reminding things.

4. Infrastructure to help machine agents do its jobs better

5. Things should be still controlable

I don't believe that truly machine-learned experiences are not optimal. 

6. Focus on the most important things.
